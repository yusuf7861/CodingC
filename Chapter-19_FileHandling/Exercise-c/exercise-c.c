It's a way to create a loop that continues executing its code block indefinitely. without any predefined condition to stop the loop. The loop condition is simply 1, which is always true, meaning the loop's code block will execute as long as the condition is true(which is always the case). This creates a loop that doesnot have a natural termination point based on the condition, resulting in an infinite loop.

        // 1. `fgets(line1, sizeof(line1), file1)`: Reads a line of text from the file `file1` and stores it in the character array `line1`, up to a maximum of `sizeof(line1)` characters.

        // 2. `!= NULL`: Compares the result of `fgets()` to check if it successfully read a line. If it successfully read a line, the result is not `NULL`.

        // 3. `fputs(line1, targetfile);`: If a line was successfully read from `file1`, it writes that line to the `targetfile`.

        // 4. `Lines++;`: Increments a counter named `Lines` to keep track of the number of lines processed.

        // In summary, this code reads a line from `file1`, checks if the read was successful, and if so, writes that line to the `targetfile`. It then increments the `Lines` counter. This code is typically used in a loop to read and write lines alternately or perform similar tasks.
